# Data Structures Examples using C++

Welcome to the Data Structures Examples using C++ repository! This repository contains a collection of data structure implementations and related problems, which I worked on during my datastructure course in my faculty. Each topic is organized into folders for easy navigation.

## Repository Structure

#### The repository is structured as follows:


- **Vector/**: Contains the implementation of the vector data structure.
- **Stack/**: Contains the implementation of the stack data structure.
- **Queue/**: Contains the implementation of the queue data structure.
- **Linked List/**: Contains the implementation of the singly linked list data structure.
- **Double Linked List/**: Contains the implementation of the doubly linked list data structure.
- **Binary Tree/**: Contains the implementation of the binary tree data structure.
- **Binary Search Tree/**: Contains the implementation of the binary search tree data structure.
- **Heap/**: Contains the implementation of the heap data structure.
- **AVL/**: Contains the implementation of the AVL tree data structure.
- **Asymptotic Complexity/**: Contains problems related to asymptotic complexity.
- **ADT/**: Contains examples related to Abstract Data Types.
- **STL/**: Contains examples using the C++ Standard Template Library.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Navigate to the folder**: Browse through the folders to find the data structure or topic you are interested in.
2. **View the implementation**: Open the `implementation.cpp` or `examples.cpp` file to see the C++ code.
3. **Read the details**: Each folder contains a `README.md` file with detailed information about the implementation or examples.
